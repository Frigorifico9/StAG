Strong Against God

Intellectual property stuff:
This is where I'm writting my novel "Strong Against God." I am using github to keep track of changes and as a backup. You are free to read anything I publish in here but keep in mind I still hold the rights to my intellectual property. I'm letting you read it, I'm not letting you have it.

What's this about:

This is the story of Jacobo. He is a priest who hires a group of mercenaries to rescue the Pope form Earth and bring him to the relative safety of the orbital cities.

But even getting the means to go to Earth is already hard enough and in the process they will travel through the Solar System, visiting the ruins of what humanity used to be, and they will meet many people and Artificial Intelligences. Jacobo will learn something from all of them and perhaps he will be ready to be Strong Against God.
